Please note, as I do not know a lot about business area and do not have business requirements I created the small template only. 
I didn't use any databases but them can be easily added based on requirements (SQL or NoSQL base). Also any other functionality can be added, please ask me to do it. The only one thing that I need to add any functionality is the requirements. 

- to run the application, run com.cf.ApplicationConfig#main method
- send your messages using /message/ URL (POST)
